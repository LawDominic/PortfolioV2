                Hi! My name is Dominic Law. I'm currently in my final year at Macquarie University studying a Bachelor of Science with a major in Computing and a Bachelor of Commerce with a major in Finance. Currently looking for opportunities in the Software Development industry whether that is entry        level, internships or graduate roles. Back in 2012, that was when my journey began, tinkering with websites and getting my hands dirty with HTML and CSS. Almost a decade later, I've expanded my skillset working with various languages for various specialties, including:
                <br />
                <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>&#8226; Java</li>
                    <li>&#8226; Python</li>
                    <li>&#8226; ReactJS</li>
                    <li>&#8226; JavaScript</li>
                    <li>&#8226; HTML</li>
                    <li>&#8226; CSS</li>
                    <li>&#8226;SQL</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <br />
                These are also the frameworks I have tinkered with: <br />
                <br/>
                <ul>
                    <li> &#8226; React Native</li>
                    <li> &#8226; Expo</li>
                    <li> &#8226; ReactJS</li>
                    <li> &#8226; Vue.js</li>
                    <li> &#8226; Boostrap</li>
                    <li> &#8226; Tailwind CSS</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>
    )
}
