            <p>
            Hi! My name is Dominic Law. I'm currently in my final year at Macquarie
            <br />
            University studying a Bachelor of Science with a major in Computing and
            <br />
            a Bachelor of Commerce with a major in Finance. Currently looking for
            <br />
            opportunities in the Software Development industry whether that is entry
            <br />
            level, internships or graduate roles.
            <br />
            <br />
            Back in 2012, that was when my journey began, tinkering with websites
            <br />
            and getting my hands dirty with HTML and CSS. Almost a decade later,
            <br />
            I've expanded my skillset working with various languages for various
            <br />
            specialities, including:
            <br />
            <br />
            &#8226; Java
            <br />
            &#8226; Python
            <br />
            &#8226; JavaScript
            <br />
            &#8226; HTML
            <br />
            &#8226; CSS
            <br />
            &#8226; SQL
            <br />
            <br />
            These are also the frameworks I have tinkered with: <br />
            <br />
            &#8226; React Native
            <br />
            &#8226; Expo
            <br />
            &#8226; Vue.js
            <br />
            &#8226; Bootstrap
            <br />
            </p>
